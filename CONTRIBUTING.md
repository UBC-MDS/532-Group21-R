# Contributing to Abalone Age Prediction Project

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to [GapExpresser](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/532-Group21). We welcome any feedback, code improvement, or bug reports.

### Fixing typos
---

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface.


### Prerequisites
---

You can triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. 

### Pull request process
---
*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  New code should follow the Black [style guide](https://github.com/psf/black).
You can use the [styler](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation_and_usage.html) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.  
*  Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.  


### Submit a Pull Request for Reviewing

- Read Code of Conduct.
